# IT115-A5-Group2

## Background
Our group project was to select an application stack and to create an IT student friendly tutorial that both builds the stack itself and utilizes a sample application
that runs off of the selected stack. We chose to run a MEAN stack on a Google Cloud virtual machine
for our project. A MEAN stack is a collection of JavaScript based technologies used to develop web applications. 
MEAN is an acronym that consists of:
 
* MongoDB (a database server) 
* Express (a server-side JavaScript framework)
* AngularJS (a front end JavaScript framework) 
* Node.js (a JavaScript execution environment or runtime)

For the application portion, we decided to develop a website which displays our tutorial,
a sample application, and additional helpful resources for an IT student to build MEAN stacks.

## Step-by-step Installation

A wonderful step-by-step tutorial was created by our stack team <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18c7CHRrGjZ5qK9Brt-y-8DYxT4aPEHqt0FGctEyiWPo" target="_blank">here</a>. 
If you do not want to run the installation step-by-step, please download the script in the next section below.
 
## Quick Installation

Please see <a href="https://github.com/Exochos/script/" target="_blank">here</a>.

This script uses Nano commands and was created in order to shorten the tedium and possible mistakes
during the installation phase. It will install a MEAN stack into the virtual machine back end, replace the older 
server.js with an updated one, and clone our Github app repo so that it can run on the front end.
