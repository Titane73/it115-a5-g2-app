# it115-a5-g2-app

Our group project was to select an application stack and to create a 
beginner friendly tutorial that both builds the stack itself and utilizes a sample application
that runs off of the selected stack. We chose to run a MEAN stack on a Google Cloud virtual machine
for our project. For the application portion, we decided to develop a website which displays our tutorial,
a sample application, and additional helpful resources for a beginner to MEAN stacks.

A wonderful step-by-step tutorial was created [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_swD14V080Rwz7PP5wOtG3xWPQBiERg_CO2vP8istXE).
 
# Quick Installation

Please see [HERE](https://github.com/Exochos/script/).

This script uses Nano commands and was created in order to shorten the tedium and possible mistakes
during the installation phase. It will install a MEAN stack into the virtual machine, replace the older 
server.js with an updated one, and clone our Github app repo into the virtual machine.
